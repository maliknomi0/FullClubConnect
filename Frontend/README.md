# Frontend

This directory contains the React application for **FullClubConnect**. It was bootstrapped with Vite and uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file with the API base url of the backend:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/v1
```

Then start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will run at `http://localhost:5173` by default.
